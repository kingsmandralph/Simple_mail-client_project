# Simple_mail-client_project
A simple mailing client project.

## Must haves to replicate:
- Have the sender and receiver email addresses
- Password to the sender's email address
- A document to send e.g a pdf file

## STEPS
- Create a password file to the sender's email and add it to the folder after you've cloned it in your local machine.
- Add the name of the password file to the string in line 11,
- Enter the  sender's email in the string in line 16,
- Enter the receiver's email in line 20, replace the "ekeneumegakwe@gmail.com",
- Add the _pdf file_ you want to send to the folder and append the name in line 28,
- In line 40 replace the sender email, and receiver's email with yours.

### Now run the file.
- You'd get an error, that's expected
- Also check your sender's email
-You would receive a mail on a login attempt to your account
- On your sender email, allow less supported apps
- And try again.
